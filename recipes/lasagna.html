    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a rich, layered Italian dish known for its comforting flavors and satisfying texture. It is traditionally made by stacking wide, flat pasta sheets with layers of savory meat sauce, creamy béchamel or ricotta cheese, and melted mozzarella. The meat sauce is typically slow-cooked with tomatoes, garlic, onions, and herbs like oregano and basil, creating a deep, aromatic base. Once assembled, the dish is baked until the top is golden and bubbling, allowing the flavors to meld together beautifully.</p>
    <p>Each bite of lasagna offers a perfect balance of tender pasta, hearty sauce, and creamy cheese. The top layer forms a slightly crisp, cheesy crust, while the inside remains soft and rich. Variations include vegetable lasagna with spinach or roasted vegetables, and even white lasagna made without tomato sauce. Whether served at family gatherings or as a comforting homemade meal, lasagna is a timeless classic that delivers warmth and indulgence in every slice.</p>
